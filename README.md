FrequencyResponse
=================
problem 1
FREQUENCY RESPONSE FOR RATIONAL SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
Objective:  Given the second order system, find and plot the log magnitude and the phase angle of the system. How the filter changes in the presence of a zero and how it affects the frequency response.


Problem 2
Objective: Plot log magnitude, phase and pole-zero for a given 3rd order IIR system. Change the position of the zeros and poles and observe the changes on cutoff frequency of the filter.
